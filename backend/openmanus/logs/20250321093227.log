2025-03-21 09:34:39.613 | INFO     | app.agent.toolcall:think:80 - ✨ Manus's thoughts: To achieve your goal of analyzing Zhang's intentional injury case, you should:

1. **Install Playwright Browsers**: If you have access to a terminal, execute the command `playwright install` to install the necessary browser binaries. This will enable you to perform web searches and gather information online.

2. **Gather Case Information**: If you have any documents or specific details about Zhang's case, please share them. This will help in analyzing the evidence chain and legal application.

3. **Search for Legal Information**: Use legal databases or websites to find information on intentional injury laws and compare them with the details of Zhang's case.

4. **Consult Legal Experts**: If possible, reach out to legal professionals for insights into the case and its legal context.

If you can perform the installation or provide more details, I can guide you further in analyzing the case. Let me know how you'd like to proceed!
