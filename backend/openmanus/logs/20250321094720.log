2025-03-21 09:48:33.469 | INFO     | app.agent.toolcall:think:80 - ✨ Manus's thoughts: To achieve your goal of analyzing the evidence chain and legal application in the "张玉环故意伤害案," you should consider the following steps:

1. **Resolve Browser Setup**: If you haven't already, run the command `playwright install` in your terminal to install the necessary browsers for Playwright. This will enable you to perform web searches and other browser interactions.

2. **Conduct Manual Research**: While resolving the browser setup, use a web browser to manually search for information about the case. Look for news articles, legal analyses, or court documents that discuss the evidence chain and legal application.

3. **Access Legal Databases**: If you have access to legal databases, search for case files or legal opinions related to the case. These resources can provide detailed insights into the legal aspects of the case.

4. **Consult Legal Experts**: Reach out to legal experts or forums where you can discuss the case and gather insights. Expert opinions can be valuable in understanding complex legal issues.

5. **Retry Web Search**: Once the browser issue is resolved, you can attempt the web search again to find more information.
